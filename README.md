# Learn Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è

You are currently browsing a repository that serves as my notes on the elementary basics of computer science.

## About the Project

The repository contains elementary theory related to computer science and programming. Each notebook includes practical programs divided into sections that are currently being discussed. The goal of the repository is not to create a guide but to group fundamental concepts in one place so that it always serves as a reference whenever I forget something or find a topic unclear. However, I have tried to simplify and generalize definitions and complex concepts as much as possible. So, if you want to use it as a learning aid for computer science, it will likely be more helpful to you than complex books with a strong focus on theory.

The project aims to:
* Organizing existing knowledge.
* Acquiring new useful skills.
